# Run Ollama
    - ollama serve (In wsl this wakes up start and might give TCP error)

# Stop Ollama :-
    - sudo systemctl stop ollama

# Restart Ollama service
    - sudo systemctl restart ollama



# Why Ollama WHY YOUR MODELS “VANISHED” AFTER terminal RESTART ?

        WSL starts the Ollama service using systemd:
        systemctl start ollama


        This service runs as a system user (ollama or nobody), not your user.
        But your .ollama folder is owned by root, so the service cannot read it.


    solution :- In WSL, enable systemd-based Ollama
    sudo systemctl enable ollama
    sudo systemctl start ollama
